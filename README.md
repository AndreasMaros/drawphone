Drawphone was built with Node.js, jQuery and [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug). It was one of my first coding projects, so the code is a bit of a mess... ðŸ˜‚

Issues, feature requests, and pull requests welcome!

## Development

#### Instructions

1. Clone the repo to get started
2. Fork and create any pull requests against the `dev` branch
3. (If needed) Install `node-canvas` dependencies: Drawphone uses [`node-canvas`](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas); on some OSes/processors, `npm` may attempt to compile/install it from source. See the `node-canvas` README for details.
4. Run `npm install`, then `npm start` to launch the server
5. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser

#### Tips

-   To change the default port, set the `PORT` environment variable
-   If you set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development`, you can use the link `localhost:3000/dev` to automatically join game `ffff`. This is helpful for speeding up debugging.
